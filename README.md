## Notes

TODO:

- add slots in topcase lower for magnets that use the ipad magnets to keep the deck closed,
  - like how the folio cases stay closed on the face of the ipad

- add power switch to turn on/off the usb dac so the ipad will still use its speakers

- test trackpad with ipad usb

- figure out wiring/hub/ports

- corner chamfers
